My submission for the https://github.com/balajis/twitter-export bounty

There is both a GUI and CLI tool. Both require a Twitter Developer App and their credentials.

Only one pacakge is required, the rest of the program uses the python standard library.

To install the package run
pip install -r requirements.txt
